[https://chartio-a-clone-o6sm.vercel.app/](https://chartio-a-clone-o6sm.vercel.app/) is a static-page clone of Chartio.com[deprecated] that I developed to explore Python and FastAPI’s potential in monolithic web applications. 

This project replicates Chartio’s interface, focusing on delivering a responsive front-end without dynamic data interactions. It serves as a foundational demonstration of how FastAPI can be utilized to efficiently structure and render static content in a monolithic architecture.
